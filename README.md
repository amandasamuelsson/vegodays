# VegoDays

VegoDays is a project created with React Native Expo by [Amanda Samuelsson](https://github.com/amandasamuelsson) and [Malin Ã–sterberg](https://github.com/msmalinosterberg).

## What is VegoDays?

We have created an application where you as a user can get inspiration to eat more vegetarian food. Our idea is to inspire and to get more people to eat less meat to help the climate. We want to prove that vegetarian food does not necessarily mean only eating salad.  
With VegoDays you can choose which days you want to eat vegetarian food and get a recipe for every chosen day. If you find a recipe, either chosen by the app or that you find in our collection of recipes, that you really enjoy you can save it to your favorite recipes.
